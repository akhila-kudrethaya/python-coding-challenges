# Problem Statement:
Reverse a given string in an efficient manner without creating new strings or performing costly concatenation operations.

**Solution Description:**
The string reversal function utilizes the two-pointer technique for an in-place reversal. It operates as follows:
  > The input string is converted into a list since strings in Python are immutable.
  > Two pointers, left and right, are initialized at the start and end of the list, respectively.
  > The characters at the left and right pointers are swapped until the pointers meet in the middle.
  > The modified list is then converted back into a string and returned.

**Key Benefits:**

i) Efficiency: The reversal is done in place, reducing both, memory usage and computational overhead.
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once.

ii) Space Complexity: O(n), as a list is created to store the characters of the input string.
